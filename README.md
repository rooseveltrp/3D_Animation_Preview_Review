# 3D Animation Preview & Feedback Tool

This is a sample project I created that anyone can use to preview a FBX 3D model, preview animations and add any design feedback right in the timeline.

## Features

* Import FBX model & animations.
* Preview lighting conditions/materials.
* Add notes/comments in the timeline.
* Import/export timeline comments.
* Record a video of the current playback.

## Technologies Used

* ThreeJS for 3D Viewport and FBX
* Node/React/TailwindCSS for UI/App
